# Architecture

## Technologies

- API client generated from swagger with [openapi-generator](https://openapi-generator.tech/)
- [RxSwift & RxCocoa](https://github.com/ReactiveX/RxSwift)
- [Cleanse](https://github.com/square/Cleanse) for dependency injection
- [R.swift](https://github.com/mac-cain13/R.swift) for strongly typed access to resources:
  - Colors: in Collors.xcassets
  - Images: in Assets.xcassets
  - Fonts
  - Strings: maintained in [POEditor](https://poeditor.com)
- SwiftUI: After the Hackathon I started to dive into SwiftUI and deicded to implement all new screens in SwiftUI (refer to eg. `Transcribe*View.swift` screens)
- [fastlane](https://fastlane.tools/) and [match](https://docs.fastlane.tools/actions/match/) for CI/CD automation
- Branche/Release model: Based on git flow:
  - we work with feature branches based on `develop`
  - features are merged via [pull requests](https://github.com/NexdApp/nexd-ios/pulls) in github
  - releases are prepared in release branches (named something like `release/*`)
  - releae branches are merged into `master` and `master` will be deployed automatically to testflight
